# BST273-Final-Project

My final project produces scatterplots based on columns of data from TSV-format input files. In my script, these files are converted to pandas data frame. The argparse module is used to implement a command-line interface with four argparse arguments. The first argument indicates the path to the input file; other three arguments are used to facilitate 1-based index of the columns containing x-values, y-values, and categorical values to produce various plots. The column containing categorical series values is used to stratify the scatterplot; if this column is not called from terminal, a default scatterplot is produced that only contains x and y values. This is accomplished using an if-else function where the stratified plot is asked to be generated when the categorical column is used. If the categorical column is not used, the else function prints the default plot. Lastly, plots are labeled, titled, and saved in your working directory using the plt functions from the matplotlib module.
